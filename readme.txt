Episode 1:
Max Design Pro is teaching a class for the Cotton Eye Joe chorus. But then, there's an identity crisis within one of his nuggets, this nugget only knows the first 3 parts of Cotton Eye Joe's chorus. But the audience helps him by liking the video, then all of the sudden he learns the rest of Cotton Eye Joe.

Episode 2:
Max Design Pro is sleeping, then a nugget goes up to him while he is catching some Z's with a speaker. Like a dick, he's planning on playing a song to wake Max up. Max in retaliation, punches a good chunk of the speaker out, and says "No God please no." And returns to sleep. The nugget asks for likes to help him in his harassment, and after he gets the likes he gets a bigger speaker right next to Max's ears and blasts Cotton Eye Joe (that's probably illegal).

Episode 3:
Max Design Pro is driving a car, a nugget walks up to the car and asks if Max can drive his car to help him escape the Pirate Nuggets. But while escaping the pirate nuggets, the car is out of fuel. So the nugget asks for likes from the audience, and then the car starts blasting Cotton Eye Joe after getting a full tank of fuel and starts speeding on the road. Nugget was found later in a horrible car accident, Max's body was nowhere to be found.

Episode 4:
A terrible, terrible incident happens. While Max Design Pro is sleeping, Little Brother and Nugget start singing Cotton Eye Joe in small bursts, and between these bursts Max wakes up. Max asks for likes or comments from the audience, in which to choose which victim to kill. Likes being the nugget, and comments being Little Brother. The audience, those sick fucks, choose likes and MURDERS NUGGET. IN COLD BLOOD. WITH A FUCKING ANVIL. STRAIGHT OUT OF A CARTOON. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS. MAX IS NOT BEATING THE COURT CASE WITH THIS ONE.

Episode 5:
Despite being murdered in the previous episode, or it's a clone. Nugget and Max decide to join a life of crime fighting. They're doing a steak out outside a bank. Then the bank gets robbed by Nugget robbers. Max Design Pro and Nugget hop in their squad car, but before they can start chasing them, just like in episode 3, the tank is empty. So, I want you to take a wild guess what happens next.

A) They shoot the robbers
B) They cry and piss their pants
C) Nuggets asks for likes and gets a full tank of fuel
D) None of the above

If you guessed option C, you would be correct, and they successfully arrest the robbers.

Episode 6:
Still in the crime fighting era, there is a Nugget stuck inside a burning building (oh no), Max and Nugget pull up in a firetruck, Max shoots the fire hose for it only shoot the last drop of water onto the ground pathetically. This is absolutely inaccurate, as they would use the fire hydrant next to the building and not the truck. The truck does not just have tanks of water for buildings. They would simply not have enough. But despite this inaccuracy, it doesn't fucking matter cause they ask for YouTube likes with the power of Bluetooth and gain infinite amounts of water and save the nugget while blasting Cotton Eye Joe.

Episode 7:
Max and Nugget are sitting in a class, Max pulls out a chocolate bar. Nugget steals the chocolate bar, and is about to eat it. But the teacher takes the bar away and teaches them about coming together and making a solution, they decided to split the bar in 3 so the teacher, Nugget, and Max can have a bit of it. They all agree. And as they agree, the teacher just eats it whole. Wrapper and everything. This man is not only a manipulator, but also can not be trusted around children. What the actual fuck. Max and Nugget, respectfully chase the teacher down the road.

Episode 8:
There is some context for this one. This is a heart breaking episode, as it's not just crime, but also Grandma Nugget was hit. Grandma Nugget was found in this episode dying on the sidewalk. But moments before this episode, Nikocado Avocado was slapped in the ass with a spatula by Max and Nugget. My theory? Nikocado Avocado hired a hitman and hit Grandma. But despite this act of violence, Max and Nugget try to save Grandma's life with defibrillators. But they don't have electricity for it. So nugget as usual, asks for YouTube likes with the power of Bluetooth. And then gets the electricity to save Grandma's life and blast Cotton Eye Joe.

Episode 9:
Max and Nugget are cops again, and they're trying to find the criminal nugget, the criminal nugget sees the cops across the street and runs away and hides around a corner. And the cops start walking around the corner. The criminal starts asking for YouTube likes. And with the power of YouTube likes he gets a decent disguise. But unfortunately, unlike the previous likes, this one was not from the power of Bluetooth. Instead it was from the power of USB 1.0. So the disguise falls off, and he gets arrested.

Episode 10:
Nugget's birthday is today. He has a party at 3 pm. But once it strikes 3 pm, no one is there to celebrate his birthday (sad). But with the power of YouTube Likes via Bluetooth, Max and his family come over to celebrate his birthday.

Episode 11:
Max is about to hit 6 million subscribers on YouTube, but he is 2 subscribers away. Nugget comes in and listens to Max's current issue then subscribes to him. But it's not enough. So by liking the video, Max gets another subscriber and hits 6 million subscribers.

Episode 12:
There is a homeless grandma nugget with a puppy on the sidewalk, a rich nugget comes by and doesn't give any money. Max walks up and wants to give money, but he has no money in his wallet. So by liking the video he magically gains money and gives it to grandma (this won't affect the economy at all), and the rich nugget's money was also stolen and magically magnetized to the homeless grandma nugget.

That is the lore of gegagedigedagedago nuggets so far. Thank you for reading.
